# agent-skill-bridge

Run Agent Skills in any existing agent without rewriting a skill runtime.

Agent Skill Bridge parses `SKILL.md`, routes user tasks to skills, progressively loads instructions and resources, exposes tools through SDK/MCP/OpenAI-compatible proxy, and traces every runtime decision.

Its core value is bringing the Agent Skills progressive disclosure model to any agent: skill directories contain `SKILL.md`; `name`, `description`, and `metadata.keywords` are available for lightweight routing; the full `SKILL.md` body is loaded only when a task selects that skill; references, scripts, and assets are read or executed only when needed.

中文说明：Agent Skill Bridge 的目标很窄，也很工程化：让任意已有 Agent 不需要重写 Skill runtime，就能运行标准 Agent Skills。它负责解析 `SKILL.md`，根据用户任务路由到合适技能，按需渐进加载完整说明和资源，通过 SDK、MCP Server、OpenAI-compatible Proxy 暴露能力，并记录每一次运行时决策的 trace。

The project can be used in three ways:

- As an embeddable TypeScript SDK.
- As an MCP server for tool-based agents.
- As an OpenAI-compatible proxy that injects Skill context and handles SkillBridge tools.

It does not define a new skill standard or marketplace. It bridges existing `SKILL.md` packages into real agent execution loops.

## Features

- Parse `SKILL.md` frontmatter and markdown body.
- Discover nested skill packages from one or more skill roots.
- Route user queries to relevant skills with keyword, name, description, and Chinese bigram matching.
- Use a pluggable routing layer with `RuleRouter` today and extension points for embedding and LLM reranking.
- Build progressive runtime context for selected skills without inlining resources.
- Enforce policy checks for permissions, trust levels, allowlists, and audit traces.
- Read skill resources safely from inside the skill directory.
- Execute local scripts from `scripts/` only, disabled by default.
- Expose tools through MCP with `skillName` based access.
- Proxy OpenAI-compatible chat completions with Skill context injection.
- Intercept OpenAI tool calls for `skillbridge_read_resource` and `skillbridge_run_script`.
- Maintain runtime trace events and expose trace IDs from the proxy.

# Code Review

Core instructions for using this skill.
```

Supported frontmatter fields:

- `name` and `description` are required.
- `version`, `license`, `author`, `compatibility`, `allowed-tools`, `denied-tools`, `permissions`, and `entrypoints` are optional.
- `compatibility` can declare `agents`, `runtimes`, and `models`.
- `metadata.keywords`, `metadata.domains`, and `metadata.taskTypes` can be string arrays or comma-separated strings.
- Raw frontmatter is preserved on `manifest.rawFrontmatter`.

## SDK Usage

```ts
import { SkillBridgeRuntime } from "@skillbridge/core";

const runtime = new SkillBridgeRuntime(["./examples/skills"]);
await runtime.init();

const prepared = await runtime.prepare({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "PR risk review" }],
  userMessage: "PR risk review",
});

console.log(prepared.activeSkills);
console.log(prepared.systemPatch);
console.log(runtime.getTrace());
```

## Progressive Runtime

SkillBridge is a progressive runtime, not a prompt concatenator.

- Level 0: the catalog loads only skill `name`, `description`, and `metadata.keywords` for routing.
- Level 1: after activation, the selected `SKILL.md` body is loaded into `systemPatch`.
- Level 2: reference files stay out of the prompt and are read only through `readResource`.
- Level 3: scripts and assets stay deferred until an explicit tool call requests them.

中文说明：SkillBridge 不会把 references、scripts、assets 一次性塞进系统提示。它先用轻量目录做路由，只在命中技能后加载该技能的 `SKILL.md` 正文；长文档、表单、检查清单、脚本和二进制资源都通过工具按需读取或执行。

Useful runtime methods:

- `init()` scans skill directories.
- `prepare()` searches skills and builds context.
- `getSkillByName(name)` resolves a scanned skill by name.
- `readResource({ skillPath, resourcePath })` reads a skill file safely.
- `runScript({ skill, scriptPath, enableScripts: true })` runs a script under `scripts/`.
- `getTrace()` and `clearTrace()` inspect or reset runtime trace events.

## Search Behavior

`searchSkills(query, skills, options)` returns normalized scores from `0` to `1`.

```ts
searchSkills("Zemax CAD 图纸", skills, {
  topK: 5,
  minScore: 0.15,
});
```

Ranking gives high weight to exact or contained skill names and `metadata.keywords`, medium weight to descriptions, and adds character bigram matching for Chinese queries.

For reusable routing decisions, use `routeSkills()` or `RuleRouter`. They return an `ActivationDecision`:

```ts
{
  selected: true,
  skill,
  candidates,
  confidence: 0.82,
  reason: "keywords matched: PR, risk",
  requiredResources: [],
  requiredTools: []
}
```

The router surface is intentionally pluggable: `RuleRouter` is the zero-dependency default, while `EmbeddingRouter` and `LlmRouter` provide integration points for vector recall and model reranking.

## MCP Server

The MCP server exposes native MCP tools, resources, and prompts.

Tools:

- `skillbridge.search`
- `skillbridge.activate`
- `skillbridge.run_script`

Resources:

- `skill://{skillName}/SKILL.md`
- `skill://{skillName}/references/{file}`
- `skill://{skillName}/assets/{file}`

Prompts:

- `skillbridge-use-skill`
- `skillbridge-debug-skill`
- `skillbridge-create-skill`

Legacy underscore tool names such as `skillbridge_search_skills` and `skillbridge_read_resource` remain available for compatibility.

Resource and script tools use `skillName`:

```json
{
  "skillName": "Code Review",
  "resourcePath": "references/guide.md"
}
```

`skillPath` is still accepted as a deprecated compatibility parameter and may be removed in `v0.2`.

By default, MCP responses hide absolute paths. Pass `--debug` to include raw paths.

```bash
node packages/mcp-server/dist/server.js --skill-dir ./examples/skills
node packages/mcp-server/dist/server.js --skill-dir ./examples/skills --enable-scripts --debug
```

## OpenAI Proxy

The proxy accepts OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` requests and can run as a prompt injector, tool-exposing proxy, or full SkillBridge loop executor.

```text
Existing Agent -> OpenAI Proxy -> SkillBridge Loop -> Target LLM
```

Environment variables:

```bash
export SKILLBRIDGE_TARGET_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com"
export SKILLBRIDGE_TARGET_API_KEY="sk-..."
export SKILLBRIDGE_SKILL_DIR="./examples/skills"
export SKILLBRIDGE_PROXY_MODE="loop"
export SKILLBRIDGE_ENABLE_SCRIPTS="false"
```

Proxy modes:

- `prompt`: inject selected `systemPatch` only.
- `tools`: inject `systemPatch` and append OpenAI tools for the external agent to execute.
- `loop`: inject `systemPatch`, append tools, execute SkillBridge tool calls locally, and call the target model again. This is the default.

Runtime context is wrapped in:

```xml
<skillbridge_runtime>
...
</skillbridge_runtime>
```

If a system message already exists, the proxy appends the wrapped context to it. Otherwise it creates a new system message.

In `tools` and `loop` modes, the proxy appends OpenAI tools:

- `skillbridge_read_resource`
- `skillbridge_run_script`

In `loop` mode, when the model returns tool calls, the proxy executes supported SkillBridge tools locally, appends tool messages, and calls the target model again. Tool loop iterations are capped by `maxToolIterations`, default `3`.

Script execution is disabled unless `SKILLBRIDGE_ENABLE_SCRIPTS=true` or the proxy is created with `enableScripts: true`.

Every proxy response includes:

```text
x-skillbridge-trace-id: <uuid>
```

## CLI

```bash
skillbridge doctor
skillbridge scan ./examples/skills
skillbridge trace ./examples/skills
skillbridge trace ./examples/skills --query "PR risk" --json
skillbridge trace ./examples/skills --query "PR risk" --explain
```

`skillbridge trace` scans the given skill directory and prints runtime trace events by default. Use `--json` or `--last` for the standard audit record, and `--explain` for a human-readable run explanation.

## Trace Events

`SkillBridgeRuntime` records:

- `scan_start`
- `scan_complete`
- `search_start`
- `skill_selected`
- `context_built`
- `policy_scan_finding`
- `policy_audit`
- `resource_read`
- `script_run_start`
- `script_run_complete`
- `script_run_failed`

Trace events include timestamps and optional metadata.

For enterprise audit workflows, `SkillBridgeRuntime.getTraceRecord()` also returns:

- `runId`
- `userMessage`
- `selectedSkill`
- scored `candidates`
- context token estimates
- tool allow/deny decisions
- script allow/deny decisions
- raw trace events

## Safety Defaults

- Resource reads are restricted to files inside the skill directory.
- `permissions.read` allowlists are enforced when declared.
- Script execution is disabled by default.
- Scripts can only run from `scripts/`.
- `permissions.execute: false` blocks script execution.
- Skill text is scanned for prompt injection, dangerous commands, metadata risk, and external download patterns.
- Policy decisions are recorded as `policy_audit` trace events.
- Shell execution is not enabled.
- OpenAI proxy script tools require explicit enablement.

## Development

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm check
```

The repository uses a TypeScript monorepo with `pnpm` workspaces and `vitest`.
